          I engineered a robust application with Key Performance Indicators
          (KPIs) for efficient gym management. This involved developing RESTful
          APIs using Nestjs in a Node environment, which allowed for seamless
          integration and optimal performance. The deployment was orchestrated
          on AWS Beanstalk, ensuring the application's scalability and
          reliability. Furthermore, I designed, trained, and integrated deep
          learning models and neural networks to optimize the KPIs. This
          demonstrated my expertise in data preprocessing, network architecture
          selection, and performance evaluation.

          I led the design and development of an innovative image recognition
          application. This involved utilizing TensorFlow for deep learning
          processing and Flask to create a user-friendly interface. I also
          optimized recognition algorithms, which improved recognition accuracy
          and reduced processing time. A robust continuous integration pipeline
          was implemented using GitLab for efficient testing and deployment.
          Finally, the application was successfully deployed on AWS, ensuring
          widespread accessibility.

          project plan. I executed backend logic development using NestJs,
          establishing a robust foundation for software evolution. Comprehensive
          testing was conducted, including unit and integration tests, and the
          application was successfully deployed on Amazon servers.

          application. I optimized algorithms to enhance application velocity,
          measured by a reduction in time and space complexity. A GitLab
          pipeline was implemented for integrations and the game was deployed on
          Amazon servers for widespread accessibility.
